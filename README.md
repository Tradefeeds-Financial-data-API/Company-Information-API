# Company-Information-API
Tradefeeds provides company information API that helps our customers streamline their projects. Through the company information API, customers can access all relevant company data including a company description, executive leadership, mission, vision, values, sector and industry of business operations, contact information and even more company details. The retrieval of this data from our API database occurs once a customer enters one of the following API filtering parameters: a stock ticker symbol, company name or ISIN number. Instead of establishing or maintaining an in-house database, you can request access to Tradefeeds company API database. You can find accurate and regularly updated all company dat. Tradefeeds' customers have a diverse background - from developers who build their applications for a specific audience to in-house teams in all-sized companies. The subscription packages are developed in such a way to serve all customers' needs. For the moment, there is no free trial provided. However, for researchers and students we further discuss such a possibilty. Feel free to contact us
